This program is meant to run two different methods that calculate the sum total of a 200,000,000 integer array with each value randomly selected between 1 and 10. The methods will then run simultaniously. The goal of this program is to see which sum method will complete it's calculations first. The time it takes to complete each sumation will then be displayed in milliseconds.
